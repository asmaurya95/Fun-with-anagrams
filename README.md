# Anagrams

An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word.For example, cinema is an anagram of iceman.
The porposed mechanics of this android application is as follows : 
- The game provides the user with a word from the dictionary.
- The user tries to create as many words as possible that contain all the letters of the given word plus one additional letter. Note that adding the extra letter at the beginning or the end without reordering the other letters is not valid. For example, if the game picks the word 'ore' as a starter, the user might guess 'rose' or 'zero' but not 'sore'.
- The user can give up and see the words that they did not guess.
